# Age range filter
Skills used in this problem: `Unit testing`, `Conditionals - logic`, `Functions - definition`,
`Functions - returning`, `Lists - initialization, modification`, `Dictionaries - iteration`,
`Dictionaries - filtering`

1. Write a function `filter_ages(data, min, max)`.
   * `data` is a dictionary: `{<name>: <age>}`, where `name` is a string and `age` is an integer
   * `min` and `max` are integers. The range is inclusive (i.e. if `min` is 10 and `max` is 15, then people of ages 10 and 15 should be included in the results).
   * `filter_ages` should return a list of names of people whose ages are between (or equal to) `min` and `max`. The return type should be a list of strings.
      * The order of the list does not matter - names can be in any order.
2. **Add at least 2 test cases.**
